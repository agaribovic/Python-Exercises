Create a class called "Vehicle" and methods that allow you to set the "Make", "Model", "Year,", and "Weight".

The class should also contain a "NeedsMaintenance" boolean that defaults to False, and and "TripsSinceMaintenance" Integer that defaults to 0.

Next an inheritance classes from Vehicle called "Cars".

The Cars class should contain a method called "Drive" that sets the state of a boolean isDriving to True.  It should have another method called "Stop" that sets the value of isDriving to false.

Switching isDriving from true to false should increment the "TripsSinceMaintenance" counter. And when TripsSinceMaintenance exceeds 100, then the NeedsMaintenance boolean should be set to true.

Add a "Repair" method to either class that resets the TripsSinceMaintenance to zero, and NeedsMaintenance to false.

Create 3 different cars, using your Cars class, and drive them all a different number of times. Then print out their values for Make, Model, Year, Weight, NeedsMaintenance, and TripsSinceMaintenance
